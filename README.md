## Key Features

- **Data Utilization:** Analysis of elemental compositions and processing parameters to predict properties like Magnetic Saturation (Bs) and Curie Temperature (Tc).
- **Machine Learning Models:** Applied Ridge Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), CatBoost, Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Dense Neural Networks to predict the material properties.
- **Prediction Results:** Model performance is evaluated using metrics such as the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) to ensure the accuracy of property predictions.
